- 👋 Hi, I’m @archika-ccsd
- 👀 I’m interested in improving the tools that I must use as an Army JROTC instructor in Clark County School District.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a better teacher, grow a new Army JROTC program, advise a cybersecurity club and use github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software challenges, advise cyber-interested Cadets, and help them grow.
- 📫 How to reach me please email me at archika@nv.ccsd.net
